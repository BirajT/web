//Combine question practice
// Write a JavaScript program using class, object, function, try-catch-finally with the following requirements:

// Create a class BankAccount with properties name and balance.

// Add a function withdraw(amount) inside the class that:

// Throws an error if the amount is greater than the current balance.

// Otherwise, deducts the amount from balance and returns the updated balance.

// Use try-catch-finally inside the withdraw function to handle errors.

// Create an object of BankAccount and perform both a valid and invalid withdrawal.
